# Sharing-App---Coursera-Capstone
Capstone Project of Coursera's Object Oriented Design Course by University of Alberta

About the Project:

The Idea of the project is to convert the user stories (Specifications) to UML Diagrams and convert UML diagrams to a working codebase.


About the App:

Sharing App allows the user to keep track of the items that they lent out to someone.

An owner can add a thing (item) to his/her things (items). Each thing is created with title, maker, description, and dimensions (Length x Width x Height).

An owner can view one of his/her things (items), its title, maker, description, dimensions and status and if it is being borrowed, the borrower.

An owner can delete a thing in his/her things.

An owner can view a list of all items, each with their title, description, and status.

An owner can view a list of all items that are available, each with their title
and description.

An owner can view a list of all items that are borrowed, each with their title
and description.

An owner can change the status of any item from "available" to "borrowed".

An owner can add/edit/delete contact.
